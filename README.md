***Abstract:*** Meta-heuristic algorithms have gained remarkable success in solving complex and large-scale problems. However, as the dimension of the problem increases, their elaborate implementations may lead to lower convergence speed and struggle with local optima easily. In this paper, a parallel Gannet Optimization Algorithm (GOA) with two novel communication strategies is proposed, and comparisons with the original GOA on 13 100-dimension benchmark functions are committed. Comprehensive experimental results indicate that the improved algorithm outperforms the original algorithm in not only better escaping local optima, but shorter running time.
